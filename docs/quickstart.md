Quick Start Guide
=================

What does the Security Monkey architecture look like?
---------------------------
Security Monkey operates in a hub-spoke type of model where Security Monkey lives in one account,
but then "reaches into" other accounts to describe and collect details.

More details on this is outlined in the IAM section below for each respective infrastructure.

Below is a diagram of the instance layout:
![diagram](images/sm_instance_diagram.png)

All of the components in the diagram should reside within the same account and region.


Setup on AWS, GCP, or OpenStack
-------------------------------

Security Monkey can run on an Amazon EC2 (AWS) instance, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance (Google Cloud Platform), or OpenStack (public or private cloud) instance.
The only real difference in the installation is the IAM configuration and the bringup of the Virtual Machine that runs Security Monkey.

### GitHub Organization Monitoring
For monitoring GitHub, please read the [GitHub monitoring documentation here](github_setup.md).


IAM Permissions
---------------
Security Monkey uses a hub-spoke type of infrastructure for describing accounts. Security Monkey requires credentials, which it then
uses to describe accounts.  The following diagram illustrates this:
![diagram](images/sm_iam_diagram.png)

### Account Types:

-   [AWS IAM instructions](iam_aws.md).
-   [GCP IAM instructions](iam_gcp.md).
-   [OpenStack IAM instructions](iam_openstack.md).
-   [GitHub instructions](github_setup.md)


Database
--------

Security Monkey needs a postgres database. Select one of the following:

-   Local Postgres (You'll set this up later once you have an instance up.).
-   [Postgres on AWS RDS](postgres_aws.md).
-   [Postgres on GCP's Cloud SQL](postgres_gcp.md).
-   Currently OpenStack utilizes a local postgres database.

Launch an Instance:
-------------------

-   [docker instructions](docker.md).
-   [Launch an AWS instance](instance_launch_aws.md).
-   [Launch a GCP instance](instance_launch_gcp.md).
-   [Launch an OpenStack instance](instance_launch_openstack.md).

Install Security Monkey on your Instance
----------------------------------------

Installation Steps:

-   Prerequisites
-   Setup a local postgres server
-   Clone security_monkey
-   Compile (or Download) the web UI
-   Review the config

### Prerequisites

Create the logging folders:

    sudo mkdir /var/log/security_monkey
    sudo mkdir /var/www
    sudo chown -R `whoami`:www-data /var/log/security_monkey/
    sudo chown www-data /var/www

Let's install the tools we need for Security Monkey:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install python-pip python-dev python-psycopg2 postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev nginx supervisor git libffi-dev gcc python-virtualenv redis-server

### Local Postgres

If you're not ready to setup AWS RDS or Cloud SQL, follow these instructions to setup a local postgres DB.

Install Postgres:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Configure the DB:

    sudo -u postgres psql
    CREATE DATABASE "secmonkey";
    CREATE ROLE "securitymonkeyuser" LOGIN PASSWORD 'securitymonkeypassword';
    CREATE SCHEMA secmonkey;
    GRANT Usage, Create ON SCHEMA "secmonkey" TO "securitymonkeyuser";
    set timezone TO 'GMT';
    select now();
    \q

### Clone security_monkey

Releases are on the master branch and are updated about every three months. Bleeding edge features are on the develop branch.

    cd /usr/local/src
    sudo git clone --depth 1 --branch develop https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey.git
    sudo chown -R `whoami`:www-data /usr/local/src/security_monkey
    cd security_monkey
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade setuptools
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade urllib3[secure]   # to prevent InsecurePlatformWarning
    pip install google-compute-engine  # Only required on GCP
    pip install cloudaux\[gcp\]
    pip install cloudaux\[openstack\]    # Only required on OpenStack
    python setup.py develop
    
### üö®‚ö†Ô∏èü•Åüé∫ ULTRA SUPER IMPORTANT SPECIAL NOTE PLEASE READ THIS üé∫ü•Å‚ö†Ô∏èüö® ###

In the commands above, a [Python virtual environment](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is created.
**ALL** Security Monkey commands from this point forward **MUST** be done from within the virtual environment. If following
the instructions above, you can get back into the virtual environment by running the following commands:
    
    cd /usr/local/src/security_monkey
    source venv/bin/activate
    

### Compile (or Download) the web UI

If you're using the stable (master) branch, you have the option of downloading the web UI instead of compiling it. Visit the latest release <https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey/releases/latest> and download static.tar.gz.

If you're using the bleeding edge (develop) branch, you will need to compile the web UI by following these instructions:

    # Get the Google Linux package signing key.
    $ curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -

    # Set up the location of the stable repository.
    cd ~
    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > dart_stable.list
    sudo mv dart_stable.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y dart

    # Build the Web UI
    cd /usr/local/src/security_monkey/dart
    /usr/lib/dart/bin/pub get
    /usr/lib/dart/bin/pub build

    # Copy the compiled Web UI to the appropriate destination
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src/security_monkey/security_monkey/static/
    sudo /bin/cp -R /usr/local/src/security_monkey/dart/build/web/* /usr/local/src/security_monkey/security_monkey/static/
    sudo chgrp -R www-data /usr/local/src/security_monkey

### Configure the Application

Security Monkey ships with a config for this quickstart guide called config.py. You can override this behavior by setting the `SECURITY_MONKEY_SETTINGS` environment variable.

Modify `env-config/config.py`:
- `FQDN`: Add the IP or DNS entry of your instance.
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: This config assumes that you are using the local db option. If you setup AWS RDS or GCP Cloud SQL as your database, you will need to modify the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI to point to your DB.
- `SECRET_KEY`: Something random.
- `SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT`: Something random.

For an explanation of the configuration options, see [options](options.md).

### Create the database tables:

Security Monkey uses Flask-Migrate (Alembic) to keep database tables up to date. To create the tables, run this command:

    cd /usr/local/src/security_monkey/
    monkey db upgrade

Populate Security Monkey with Accounts
--------------------------------------

### Add Amazon Accounts (AWS ONLY)

If you don't use AWS, you can skip this section.

Security Monkey has the ability to check which accounts are accessing your resources. This is helpful to
detect if there is unknown cross-account access. In some cases, your items will be configured to permit
Amazon owned accounts that provide specific AWS services, such as ELB access logging. Security Monkey is 
equipped with a command to automatically add these accounts to the database, which will prevent Security Monkey
from raising an "unknown cross-account access" issue on a given item.

To add the "friendly" Amazon service accounts to Security Monkey, please run the command:

    monkey amazon_accounts    

### Add Your AWS/GCP Accounts

You'll need to add at least one account before starting the scheduler. It's easiest to add them from the command line, but it can also be done through the web UI. :

    monkey add_account_aws
    usage: monkey add_account_aws [-h] -n NAME [--thirdparty] [--active]
                                  [--notes NOTES] --id IDENTIFIER
                                  [--update-existing]
                                  [--canonical_id CANONICAL_ID]
                                  [--s3_name S3_NAME] [--role_name ROLE_NAME]

    monkey add_account_gcp
    usage: monkey add_account_gcp [-h] -n NAME [--thirdparty] [--active]
                                  [--notes NOTES] --id IDENTIFIER
                                  [--update-existing] [--creds_file CREDS_FILE]

    monkey add_account_openstack
    usage: monkey add_account_openstack [-h] -n NAME [--thirdparty] [--active]
                                  [--notes NOTES] --id IDENTIFIER
                                  [--update-existing]
                                  [--cloudsyaml_file CLOUDSYAML_FILE]

For clarity: the `-n NAME` refers to the name that you want Security Monkey to use to associate with the account.
A common example would be "test" for your testing AWS account or "prod" for your main production AWS account. These names are unique.

The `--id IDENTIFIER` is the back-end cloud service identifier for a given provider. For AWS, it's the 12 digit account number, 
and for GCP, it's the project ID. For OpenStack, it's the cloud configuration to load from the clouds.yaml file.

### Syncing With SWAG

If you're using [SWAG](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/swag-client). You can populate your database via the following command:

    monkey sync_swag --owner <example-corp> --bucket-name <my-bucket> --bucket-prefix accounts.json --bucket-region us-east-1 -u


### AWS Only: S3 Canonical IDs

If you are not using AWS, you can skip this section. If you are using AWS, you should run the command (this command should
be run on the Security Monkey instance or otherwise in a place with AWS credentials. For more details, please review the
[AWS IAM instructions](iam_aws.md)):
    
    monkey fetch_aws_canonical_ids
    usage: monkey fetch_aws_canonical_ids [-h] [--override OVERRIDE]

    Adds S3 canonical IDs in for all AWS accounts in SM.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --override OVERRIDE

AWS S3 has an ACL system that makes use of Canonical IDs. This is documented [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html).
These IDs are not easy to find, but are very important for Security Monkey to know if an S3 bucket has unknown cross-account access.
The above command is a convenience to automatically find those Canonical IDs and associate them with your account. It is highly recommended that you run this command after you add an AWS account.

### Create the first user:

Users can be created on the command line or by registering in the web UI:

    $ monkey create_user "you@youremail.com" "Admin"
    > Password:
    > Confirm Password:

`create_user` takes two parameters:
- email address
- role (One of `[View, Comment, Justify, Admin]`)


Create an SSL Certificate
-------------------------

For this quickstart guide, we will use a self-signed SSL certificate. In production, you will want to use a certificate that has been signed by a trusted certificate authority.:

    $ cd ~

There are some great instructions for generating a certificate on the Ubuntu website:

[Ubuntu - Create a Self Signed SSL Certificate](https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/certificates-and-security.html)

The last commands you need to run from that tutorial are in the "Installing the Certificate" section:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo cp server.crt /etc/ssl/certs
sudo cp server.key /etc/ssl/private
~~~~

Once you have finished the instructions at the link above, and these two files are in your /etc/ssl/certs and /etc/ssl/private, you are ready to move on in this guide.

Setup Nginx:
------------

Security Monkey uses gunicorn to serve up content on its internal 127.0.0.1 address. For better performance, and to offload the work of serving static files, we wrap gunicorn with nginx. Nginx listens on 0.0.0.0 and proxies some connections to gunicorn for processing and serves up static files quickly.

### securitymonkey.conf

Copy the config file into place:

    sudo cp /usr/local/src/security_monkey/nginx/security_monkey.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/security_monkey.conf
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/security_monkey.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/security_monkey.conf
    sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sudo service nginx restart

Logging into the UI
-------------------

You should now be able to reach your server

![image](images/resized_login_page-1.png)

Loading Data into Security Monkey
--------------------------------
To initially get data into Security Monkey, you can run the `monkey find_changes` command. This will go through
all your configured accounts in Security Monkey, fetch details about the accounts, store them into the database,
and then audit the items for any issues. 

The `find_changes` command can be further scoped to account and technology with the `-a account` and `-m technology` parameters.

*Note:* This is good for loading some initial data to play around with, however, you will want to configure jobs to automatically
scan your environment periodically for changes.  Please read the next section for details.

üö® Important üö® - Autostarting and Fetching Data
--------------------------------
At this point Security Monkey is set to manually run. However, we need to ensure that it is always running and automatically
fetching data from your environment.

Please review the next section titled [Autostarting Security Monkey](autostarting.md) for details. Please note, this section
is very important and involved, so please pay close attention to the details.
